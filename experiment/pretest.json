        "a": "Reflection is when a wave bounces back from a barrier.",
        "b": "Dispersion refers to the spreading of waves.",
        "c": "Correct! Quantum tunnelling allows particles to pass through barriers even when they don't have enough energy classically. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tunnelling'>Read more</a>",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "That would be the Reflection %, not Transmission %.",
