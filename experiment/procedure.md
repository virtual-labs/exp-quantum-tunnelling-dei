### Procedure
Step 1: Change the clock ticks to change curve so the curve changes.<br />
Step 2: Study the graph<br />
Step 3: Control speed and study graph<br />
Step 4: finish with the experiment<br />
Step 5: Fill the table given below<br />
Step5 : Plot the graph between Barrier width and %wave passed<br />
| S.no | Barrier_Width    | Measure the distance (percentage of the wave passed)|
