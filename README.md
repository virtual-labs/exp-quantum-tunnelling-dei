<b> Experiment|     <b> Quantum Tunnelling Through Potential Barrier

### About the Experiment 

This experiment demonstrates how quantum particles can penetrate and pass through potential barriers even when their energy is less than the barrier height, a phenomenon called tunnelling. It illustrates the wave nature of particles and the non-zero probability of barrier transmission predicted by quantum mechanics.
