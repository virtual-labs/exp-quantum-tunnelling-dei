      "question": "1. After conducting the simulation, if the Transmission % was 35% and Reflection % was 65%, what is the transmission coefficient T?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "0.35",
        "b": "0.65",
        "c": "1.00",
        "d": "0.30"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! Transmission coefficient T = 0.35 (or 35% expressed as a decimal).",
        "b": "This is the reflection coefficient R, not transmission T.",
        "c": "This would mean 100% transmission, which is not the case.",
        "d": "This doesn't match the given percentage."

      "difficulty": "beginner"
    },
    {
      "question": "2. In the 'Easy Tunnel' preset scenario, why is the transmission percentage high?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Because barrier width is very large",
        "b": "Because particle energy (E) is high relative to barrier height (V₀)",
        "c": "Because the simulation speed is faster",
        "d": "Because the grid is enabled"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Large barrier width would decrease transmission, not increase it.",
        "b": "Correct! In Easy Tunnel, E is high and V₀ is low, making tunnelling easier.",
        "c": "Speed doesn't affect the physics, only the animation rate.",
        "d": "Grid is just a visual aid and doesn't affect the physics."

    {
      "question": "3. When you varied the Barrier Width from 10 to 50 while keeping E and V₀ constant, what pattern did you observe?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Transmission increased linearly",
        "b": "Transmission decreased exponentially",
        "c": "Transmission remained constant",
        "d": "Transmission oscillated randomly"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Transmission doesn't increase with width.",
        "b": "Correct! Transmission coefficient decreases exponentially with barrier width: T ∝ e^(-2κL)",
        "c": "Incorrect. Width significantly affects transmission.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The relationship is deterministic, not random."

      "question": "4. In the simulation, what happens to the wavefunction inside the potential barrier?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It oscillates with constant amplitude",
        "b": "It becomes zero immediately",
        "c": "It decreases exponentially",
        "d": "It increases exponentially"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Oscillation occurs outside the barrier, not inside.",
        "b": "The wavefunction doesn't vanish immediately.",
        "c": "Correct! Inside the barrier (when E < V₀), the wavefunction shows exponential decay.",
        "d": "Exponential increase would violate conservation principles."

      "difficulty": "intermediate"
    },
    {
      "question": "5. In the 'Classical' preset where E > V₀, what did you observe?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "No wave passed through",
        "b": "High transmission but still some reflection (quantum effect)",
        "c": "Exactly 100% transmission",
        "d": "The simulation stopped working"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. When E > V₀, particles can classically pass over the barrier.",
        "b": "Correct! Even when E > V₀, quantum mechanics predicts some reflection - this is a purely quantum effect with no classical analogue.",
        "c": "Due to quantum effects, there's always some reflection even when E > V₀.",
        "d": "The simulation works correctly in all presets."

      "question": "6. Based on your graph of Barrier Width vs Transmission %, which mathematical relationship best describes the curve?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Linear: T = -mL + c",
        "b": "Quadratic: T = aL²",
        "c": "Exponential decay: T = e^(-2κL)",
        "d": "Logarithmic: T = log(L)"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "A linear relationship doesn't match the observed curve.",
        "b": "A quadratic relationship is not observed in tunnelling.",
        "c": "Correct! The transmission coefficient follows exponential decay with barrier width.",
        "d": "A logarithmic relationship doesn't match tunnelling physics."

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Step potential doesn't allow complete transmission for E < V₀.",
        "b": "Correct! At a step potential (infinite width), no wave can transmit through - all is reflected at the discontinuity.",
        "c": "Wave conservation is maintained; it reflects back.",
        "d": "In step potential, width is essentially infinite."
